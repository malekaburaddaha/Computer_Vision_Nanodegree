# This file includes most of the exercises notebook in the Computer Vision nanodegree, and in this Readme file We will try to talk about each notebook briefely. 

### Blue Screen: 
In this notebook I have uploaded an image and masked it, then changed and added a background to the image. It is a simplt masking task.


### Canny Edge Detection:

In this notebook I use the canny edge detector with a specified upper and lower thresholds to detect the edges of a sample image, and by edges I mean an intensity difference in the image. 


### Creating a Filter, Edge Detection

In this notebook I create a filter and apply it to a sample image, where it detects vertical and horizontal edges
this kind of filters could be a step in lane detection for self driving vehicles.
